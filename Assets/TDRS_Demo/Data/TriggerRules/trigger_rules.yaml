# This file contains sample trigger rules authored using YAML.
# Rules should be specified using a YAML sequence syntax.
# They are loaded when the social engine is initialized and
# are evaluated every time step.
# Trigger rules have the same fields as social events, but
# they contain additional information to guide how frequently
# and how many times a rule can be triggered.

- # Every rule starts with an ID that must be unique among all other rules.
  name: Betrayal

  # Roles/variables that must be bound by the precondition.
  roles:
    - "?betrayer"
    - "?victim"

  # Text describing what happened with this rule.
  description: "[betrayer] betrayed [victim]."

  # If the trigger rule attribute is provided with a social event. It contains metadata required
  # for automatically triggering the event during simulation steps.
  triggerRules:
    # Can this rule be used again once it has been triggered.
    - isRepeatable: true

      # The maximum number of times this rule can be triggered within a single time step.
      maxUsesPerTick: 1

      # The cooldown is the number of simulation ticks that must elapse before the rule
      # can be trigger again.
      cooldown: 3

      # Preconditions are specified using YAML sequences where a rule only needs
      # one precondition query to pass. In this way, rule preconditions entries operate with
      # implicit OR.
      preconditions:
        - "?betrayer.relationships.?victim.stats.Friendship!?val"
        - "lte ?val 0"

  # A sequence of response objects that specify how the agents involved, or those related
  # to them should respond when this rule is triggered. Entries must contain an 'effects'
  # attribute and may optionally specify a 'precondition' attribute. If no precondition is
  # provided, the effect runs using the variables bound from the rule's precondition.
  # However, if a precondition is specified, the variables from the rule's precondition are
  # bound first, then the precondition runs with those variables pre-bound.
  responses:
    - effects:
        - "DecreaseRelationshipStat ?victim ?betrayer Friendship 15"
        - "RemoveRelationshipTrait ?victim ?betrayer friend"
    - preconditions:
        - "?victim.relationships.?victim_friend.traits.friend"
        - "neq ?victim_friend ?betrayer"
      effects:
