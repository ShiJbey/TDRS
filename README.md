**Unity-TDRS** is a toolkit for modeling dynamic character relationships for life sims, dating sims, visual novels, and adventure games in Unity. It enables game developers to track relationships between social entities (NPCs, players, factions, etc.). Designers can create and tag relationships and characters with various traits that modify how characters feel about each other. Also, they can dispatch various event types that change relationships and build interpersonal histories between characters. Game designers can leverage this package for NPC decision-making, customizing dialogue, and adding a semblance of social intelligence.

## Features

- ‚ù§Ô∏è Model relationships between Agents (NPCs, Groups, and Player(s))
- üìä Track various agent and relationship stat values like sociability, confidence, friendship, romance, trust, and reputation.
- üè∑Ô∏è Tag agents and relationships with various traits to influence stats
- üìè Associate traits with social rules that change how characters treat others
- üéä Uses an expressive event system to propagate information

## What this project is **NOT**

This project does not contain code for autonomous character decision-making or text generation. TDRS is a solution for modeling dynamic relationships and making the data available to other systems in a game. You can think of it like a physics engine. It exists to do one thing well and support the rest of the design.

## Project contents

This repository contains a Unity project with Unity-TDRS added as an embedded package. The package-specific code can be found in the `Packages/Unity-TDRS` directory. All other data found in the `Assets` folder belong to the samples and are not included in the final package distribution.

## Installation instructions

The following are instructions for installing `Unity-TDRS` into your Unity project. This project uses semantic versioning. So, major version numbers will have breaking changes. Minor version changes will mostly contain new features, but there is always a chance of a breaking change. Please check the [CHANGE LOG](./CHANGELOG.md) or release notes to see what changed between releases.

To add TDRS to your Unity project, you must download the latest version of the package from GitHub. TDRS is not available in the Unity Asset store. All releases are on the [Unity-TDRS GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/ShiJbey/Unity-TDRS/releases). Please follow the steps below.

1. Find your desired release.
2. Download the `unity-tdrs_<VERSION>.tar.gz` from under the `Assets` dropdown (\<VERSION\> should be the release version you intend to download).
3. Open your project in Unity
4. Navigate to `Window > Package Manager` in the top menu.
5. Click the `+` icon in the top left and select `Add package from tarball...`.
6. Find and select the downloaded tarball
7. You should now see Unity-TDRS appear in the Unity Package Manager window with a version number matching your downloaded version.
8. Close the Package Manager window

## Dependencies

- Unity version 2022.3 or more recent

## Limitations

- Unity-TDRS is not optimized to handle a large number of NPCs. Some users might encounter performance slow-downs if they try to make something like Crusader Kings. More extensive performance profiling is required to investigate this.

## Documentation and Workflows

You can learn more about TDRS and how to get started by visiting the [Wiki](https://github.com/ShiJbey/Unity-TDRS/wiki). There are pages to walk you through common tasks and workflows.

## Frequently asked questions

### How do I persist data between scenes

Unity-TDRS does not offer a particular solution for persisting social data between scenes. This task is left to the discretion of the user. If you have ideas for a solution, please create a GitHub issue explaining your approach.
